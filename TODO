TODO
----

* Add mechanism to find best matching type for a given primitive.

* Add finite limits to all "primitive" types.
* Add optional constraint on Date for the timezone
* Add optional constraint on DateTime for the timezone
* Add optional constraint on Time for the timezone

* Check the order of the constraints. Some of the respond_to? tests shouldn't be
  needed if earlier type testing had failed and short-circuited the conditional.

* When axiom-logic is available, replace the Proc based constraints with real
  predicates so that they can be serialized into SQL or optimized, etc.
  * Can be performed as part of type finalization
